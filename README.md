# Pressure-Sensors

Manufactured and packaged a pressure sensor by utilizing a silicon wafer coupled with a nitride layer serving as a diaphragm to gauge pressure levels. A layer of chromium was deposited on the wafer, used for the strain gauges to detect the deflection.

By analyzing the voltage disparity within the Wheatstone bridge setup to test the fluctuations in the current , the strain gauge's resistance concerning the applied pressure was determined. This project's primary goal was to manufacture silicon pressure sensors, determine their device resistivity and sensitivity, and evaluate their performance through rigorous testing procedures.
